# Automatic_water_level_controller_using_IC555
The project “Automatic Water Level Controller using IC555” is designed to monitor and control the water level in a tank automatically. Using the IC555 timer as a switching circuit, it prevents overflow and dry running of the motor by turning it ON when the water level is low and OFF when the tank is full, ensuring efficient water usage.
